Combinators
================

Adjacent Sibling
----------------

h1 + p {

}

- Property will only be applied to p element if it directly follows a h1 tag.
- Elements share the same parent.
- Secodn element comes immediately after fisrt element.

General Sibling
---------------

h2 ~ p {

}

- P comes after h1, but does not have to be directly after it.

Child Combinator
----------------

div > p {

}

- Any p that is a direct child of a div, will get the style specified.

Decendant Combinator
--------------------

div p {

}

- All p elements inside the div will get the style applied.


Margin-Collapsing
-----------------

- 2 elements under each other -> the bigger margin wins.
- Work around => use margin-top / margin-bottom.

box-sizing: border-box => calculates total width with padding and border added to the total width.

Pseudo Classes
===============
 Defines the style of a special state of an element
 :class name

 h1:hover {}

 Pseudo Elements
 ===============
 DEfines the stule of a specific part of an element.

 h1::active {}

 Z-Index:
 ========
 Wont work if there is no position Property applied to the element.

 Sticky: Hybrid between relative and fixed.
